# Web Proxy using Docker, NGINX and Let's Encrypt

With this repo you will be able to set up your server with multiple sites using a single NGINX proxy to manage your connections, automating your apps container (port 80 and 443) to auto renew your ssl certificates with Let´s Encrypt.

Something like:

![Web Proxy environment](https://github.com/evertramos/images/raw/master/webproxy.jpg)


## Why use it?

Using this set up you will be able start a production environment in a few seconds. For each new web project simply start the containers with the option `-e VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com` and you will be ready to go. If you want to use SSL (Let's Encrypt) just add the tag `-e LETSENCRYPT_HOST=your.domain.com`. Done!

Easy and trustworthy!


## Prerequisites

In order to use this compose file (docker-compose.yml) you must have:

1. docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
2. docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


## How to use it

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evertramos/docker-compose-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion.git
```

2. Make a copy of our `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`:

Update this file with your preferences.

```
#
# docker-compose-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion
# 
# A Web Proxy using docker with NGINX and Let's Encrypt
# Using the great community docker-gen, nginx-proxy and docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion
#
# This is the .env file to set up your webproxy enviornment

#
# Your local containers NAME
#
NGINX_WEB=nginx-web
DOCKER_GEN=nginx-gen
LETS_ENCRYPT=nginx-letsencrypt

#
# Your external IP address
#
IP=0.0.0.0

#
# Default Network
#
NETWORK=webproxy

#
# Service Network
#
# This is optional in case you decide to add a new network to your services containers
#SERVICE_NETWORK=webservices

#
# NGINX file path
#
NGINX_FILES_PATH=/path/to/your/nginx/data

#
# NGINX use special conf files
#
# In case you want to add some special configuration to your NGINX Web Proxy you could
# add your files to ./conf.d/ folder as of sample file 'uploadsize.conf'
#
# [WARNING] This setting was built to use our `start.sh`.
#
# [WARNING] Once you set this options to true all your files will be copied to data
#           folder (./data/conf.d). If you decide to remove this special configuration
#           you must delete your files from data folder ./data/conf.d.
#
#USE_NGINX_CONF_FILES=true

#
# Docker Logging Config
#
# This section offers two options max-size and max-file, which follow the docker documentation
# as follow:
#
# logging:
#      driver: "json-file"
#      options:
#        max-size: "200k"
#        max-file: "10"
#
#NGINX_WEB_LOG_MAX_SIZE=4m
#NGINX_WEB_LOG_MAX_FILE=10

#NGINX_GEN_LOG_MAX_SIZE=2m
#NGINX_GEN_LOG_MAX_FILE=10

#NGINX_LETSENCRYPT_LOG_MAX_SIZE=2m
#NGINX_LETSENCRYPT_LOG_MAX_FILE=10
```

3. Run our start script

```bash
./start.sh
```

Your proxy is ready to go!

## Starting your web containers

After following the steps above you can start new web containers with port 80 open and add the option `-e VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com` so proxy will automatically generate the reverse script in NGINX Proxy to forward new connections to your web/app container, as of:

```bash
docker run -d -e VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com \
              --network=webproxy \
              --name my_app \
              httpd:alpine
```

To have SSL in your web/app you just add the option `-e LETSENCRYPT_HOST=your.domain.com`, as follow:

```bash
docker run -d -e VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com \
              -e LETSENCRYPT_HOST=your.domain.com \
              -e LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=your.email@your.domain.com \
              --network=webproxy \
              --name my_app \
              httpd:alpine
```

> You don´t need to open port *443* in your container, the certificate validation is managed by the web proxy.


> Please note that when running a new container to generate certificates with LetsEncrypt (`-e LETSENCRYPT_HOST=your.domain.com`), it may take a few minutes, depending on multiples circumstances.

## Further Options

1. Basic Authentication Support

In order to be able to secure your virtual host with basic authentication, you must create a htpasswd file within `${NGINX_FILES_PATH}/htpasswd/${VIRTUAL_HOST}` via:

```bash
sudo sh -c "echo -n '[username]:' >> ${NGINX_FILES_PATH}/htpasswd/${VIRTUAL_HOST}"
sudo sh -c "openssl passwd -apr1 >> ${NGINX_FILES_PATH}/htpasswd/${VIRTUAL_HOST}"
```

> Please substitute the `${NGINX_FILES_PATH}` with your path information, replace `[username]` with your username and `${VIRTUAL_HOST}` with your host's domain. You will be prompted for a password.

2. Using multiple networks

If you want to use more than one network to better organize your environment you could set the option `SERVICE_NETWORK` in our `.env.sample` or you can just create your own network and attach all your containers as of:

```bash
docker network create myownnetwork
docker network connect myownnetwork nginx-web
docker network connect myownnetwork nginx-gen
docker network connect myownnetwork nginx-letsencrypt
```

3. Using different ports to be proxied

If your service container runs on port 8545 you probably will need to add the `VIRTUAL_PORT` environment variable to your container, in the `docker-compose.yml`, as of:

```bash
parity
    image: parity/parity:v1.8.9
    [...]
    environment:
      [...]
      VIRTUAL_PORT: 8545
```

Or as of below:

```bash
docker run [...] -e VIRTUAL_PORT=8545 [...]
```

## Testing your proxy with scripts preconfigured 

1. Run the script `test.sh` informing your domain already configured in your DNS to point out to your server as follow:

```bash
./test_start.sh your.domain.com
```

or simply run:

```bash
docker run -dit -e VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com --network=webproxy --name test-web httpd:alpine
```

Access your browser with your domain!

To stop and remove your test container run our `stop_test.sh` script:

```bash
./test_stop.sh
```

Or simply run:

```bash
docker stop test-web && docker rm test-web 
```

## Production Environment using Web Proxy and Wordpress

1. [docker-wordpress-letsencrypt](https://github.com/evertramos/docker-wordpress-letsencrypt)
2. [docker-portainer-letsencrypt](https://github.com/evertramos/docker-portainer-letsencrypt)
3. [docker-nextcloud-letsencrypt](https://github.com/evertramos/docker-nextcloud-letsencrypt)

In this repo you will find a docker-compose file to start a production environment for a new wordpress site.
